Nodeflix
===============
A simple Netflix API client for node.js.

Installing
---------------

    npm install nodeflix

Usage Examples
---------------

    var nodeflix = require('./nodeflix');

    var n = new nodeflix({
        consumer_key:       '',
        consumer_secret:    '',
        oauth_token:        '',     // optional, for signed user requests
        oauth_token_secret: '',     // optional, for signed user requests
        user_id:            ''      // optional, for signed user requests
    });

    // get user information (colon prefixed strings will be replaced with matching config option(s) for convenience e.g. ':user_id')
    n.get('/users/:user_id', function() {
        console.log(this.toJSON());
    });

    // lookup something from the people catalog
    n.get('/catalog/people', { term: 'DeNiro' }, function(data) {
        console.log(data);
    });

    // delete something from a user's instant queue
    n.delete('/users/:user_id/queues/instant/saved/60022048', function(data) {
        if(data.status && data.status.status_code == 200) {
            console.log('Item successfully deleted!');
        }
    });

    // add something to a user's instant queue
    n.post('/users/:user_id/queues/instant', { title_ref: '/catalog/titles/series/70158331'}, function(data) {
        if(data.status && data.status.message == 'success') {
            console.log('Item successfully added to instant queue!')
        }
    });

    // also supports simple "deferred-like" (not a true deferred right now) syntax
    n.get('/catalog/people', { term: 'Brad Pitt'}).end(function() {
        console.log(this.toJSON());
    });

    // chaining is all the rage these days
    n.get('/catalog/people', { term: 'Bruce Willis' }).end(function() {
        console.log(this.toJSON());
    }).get('/catalog/titles', { term: 'Voyager'}).end(function() {
        console.log(this.toJSON());
    });

Notes
---------------

This is an unofficial Netflix client. I take no responsibility for how you use it or if it does something bad. 
Please see the complete Netflix API Reference at http://developer.netflix.com/docs/REST_API_Reference. All methods are supported.
Also note you'll need to sign up to Netflix's developer program to get your own consumer_key and consumer_secret to use the API.

To make signed user requests (to manage a user's queue, for instance), you'll also need to provide a valid oauth_token, oauth_token_secret and an encrypted Netflix user_id. More details can be found at Netflix's Authentication documentation and walk-through at:

http://developer.netflix.com/docs/read/Security and http://developer.netflix.com/walkthrough

TODO
----------------

* Built-in pagination in response object (this.next() this.previous(), this.total() etc)
* Better handling of HTTP status codes
* Support oauth token request process for user tokens
* Automatic/On-Demand Object hydration of Netflix-style resource URLs
* Don't sign request for autocomplete style requests/allow it to be turned off
